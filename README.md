# Project Scope

In this project, you have to identify and describe business problems or areas of interest that are related to
the given data set. The big data pipeline should involve investigation and exploration of the big data before
performing analysis and developing a set of conclusions.
At the end of the big data pipeline, you will evaluate the effectiveness of the analytics solutions in terms of
predictive accuracies as well as system scalability.
The evaluation of the results or conclusions should be supported by some metrics collected during the
machine learning flow.



## Business Scenario

In recent years, there was an overall decrease in ticket sales, caused by various external factors (Socio-economic, Politics, Environmental) which resulted in a 6.2million USD loss in 2019.
Hence, our aim is to improve the overall performance of American Airlines, a prominent airline company in the United States.

Our objective is to gain valuable insights into multiple aspects of the airline industry. Such as pricing trends, flight delays, consumer perspectives, and seat availability., from 2017 to 2019. 
Furthermore. We aim to conduct a comparative analysis between American Airlines and its primary competitors, United Airlines & Delta Airlines. To pinpoint areas for improvement and potential competitive advantages.

Insights that are derived from our analysis will help in discovering what factors affect ticket sales the most, and how we can maintain or improve upon them.


## Project Background
